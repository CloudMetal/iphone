Yammer iPhone App README

Welcome to the Yammer iPhone App open source project.  The first version of this app was released via the iTunes store in September of 2008.  Yammer won TechCrunch50 that year:

http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/10/yammer-takes-techcrunch50s-top-prize/

and has been gaining momentum as a tool to make companies and organizations more efficient.  We are excited you would like to help make the Yammer iPhone app even better.

To run a copy of the code on your iPhone simulator via xcode you will need to register a new application:

https://www.yammer.com/client_applications/new

For general information on developing iphone apps please see:

http://developer.apple.com/iphone/

After you have checked out a copy of the code, you should make a new file with any text editor called OAuthCustom.m and place it in the Classes directory:

#import "OAuthCustom.h"

@implementation OAuthCustom

+ (NSString*)theKey        { return @"REPLACE_WITH_KEY"; }
+ (NSString*)secret        { return @"REPLACE_WITH_SECRET"; }

+ (NSString*)devServer     { return @""; }
+ (NSString*)devNetworks   { return @""; }
+ (BOOL)callbackTokenInURL { return NO; }

@end

Use the values for REPLACE_WITH_KEY and REPLACE_WITH_SECRET from the new application you registered on yammer.
You can leave the other values as they are.

You also need to checkout three20 we have a fork of it here:

http://github.com/andrewfromyammer/three20

It should be placed at the same directory level as the yammer_iphone directory.

So if you have a directory called "myprojects" you'll want:

myprojects
  yammer_iphone
  three20
  
because yammer_iphone will look for "../three20/src" and the .. means up on directory from where you are.
