Yammer iPhone App README

Welcome to the Yammer iPhone App open source project.  The first version of this app was released via the iTunes store in September of 2008.  Yammer won TechCrunch50 that year:

and has been gaining momentum as a tool to make companies and organizations more efficient.  We are excited you would like to help make the Yammer iPhone app even better.

To run a copy of the code on your iPhone simulator via xcode you will need to register a new application:

https://www.yammer.com/client_applications/new

For general information on developing iphone apps please see:

http://developer.apple.com/iphone/

After you have checked out a copy of the code, you should have a folder called "Classes" in your yammer_iphone directory.  Inside that directory should be another folder called "Util".  Create a new file in this directory called "OAuthCustom.h" and put the following in that file:

static NSString *OAUTH_KEY    = @"REPLACE_WITH_KEY";
static NSString *OAUTH_SECRET = @"REPLACE_WITH_SECRET";
static NSString *DEV_SERVER   = @"";
static NSString *DEV_NETWORKS = @"";

Only use the values for REPLACE_WITH_KEY and REPLACE_WITH_SECRET from the new application you registered on yammer.
You can leave DEV_SERVER and DEV_NETWORKS set to empty strings.

Overview of Main Classes
-----------

1. YammerAppDelegate
2. MainTabBarController
3. SpinnerViewController
4. FeedMessageList
5. FeedsViewController
6. DirectoryViewController
7. SettingsViewController

YammerAppDelegate is where control starts.  The iphone calls "applicationDidFinishLaunching" and everything gets setup from there.

MainTabBarController is set as the main view once logged in, and it has four tabs.  Each tab is a subclass of SpinnerViewController.

SpinnerViewController shows the word "Loading..." with a UIActivityIndicatorView spinning while a thread is started.

The home tab is an instance of FeedMessageList with a specific feed the user can set in settings.  It loads its messages via the API in the loadData thread and then calls the super method to stop the spinner.

The feed tab is an instance of FeedsViewController.  It loads the list of feeds for the user via the api during the spinner thread.

The directory tab is an instance of DirectoryViewController.  It loads the list of users via the api during the spinner thread.

The settings tab is an instance of SettingsViewController.  It also loads a list of feeds since the user can select a feed for the home page.
