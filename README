Yammer iPhone App README

Welcome to the Yammer iPhone App open source project.  The first version of this app was released via the iTunes store in September of 2008.  Yammer won TechCrunch50 that year:

and has been gaining momentum as a tool to make companies and organizations more efficient.  We are excited you would like to help make the Yammer iPhone app even better.

To run a copy of the code on your iPhone simulator via xcode you will need to register a new application:

https://www.yammer.com/client_applications/new

For general information on developing iphone apps please see:

http://developer.apple.com/iphone/

Clone both yammer_iphone and three20 like so:

demo 505 $ git clone git://github.com/andrewfromyammer/yammer_iphone.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/aa/demo/yammer_iphone/.git/
remote: Counting objects: 1710, done.

demo 506 $ git clone git://github.com/andrewfromyammer/three20.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/aa/demo/three20/.git/
remote: Counting objects: 5321, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1361/1361), done.
remote: Total 5321 (delta 4265), reused 4748 (delta 3715)
Receiving objects: 100% (5321/5321), 1.13 MiB | 1929 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (4265/4265), done.

Then run this command to create this empty file:

demo 507 $ touch yammer_iphone/Classes/OAuthCustom.m

Now open the "Yammer.xcodeproj" project.  And select that OAuthCustom.m file in the left hand side and paste in this:

#import "OAuthCustom.h"

@implementation OAuthCustom

+ (NSString*)theKey        { return @"REPLACE_WITH_KEY"; }
+ (NSString*)secret        { return @"REPLACE_WITH_SECRET"; }

+ (NSString*)devServer     { return @""; }
+ (NSString*)devNetworks   { return @""; }
+ (BOOL)callbackTokenInURL { return NO; }

@end

Use the values for REPLACE_WITH_KEY and REPLACE_WITH_SECRET from the new application you registered on yammer.
You can leave the other values as they are.

three20 should be placed at the same directory level as the yammer_iphone directory.

So if you have a directory called "demo" you'll want:

demo
  yammer_iphone
  three20
  
because yammer_iphone will look for "../three20/src" and the .. means up on directory from where you are.


Build and run in the simulator and it should all work.  No need to configure three20 anymore, all the settings should work as is.
